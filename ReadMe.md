## REQUIRED
* Setup an API with a project structure like:
```
/client
/server
--/routes
----index.js
----chirps.js
--server.js
--chirpsstore.js (file provided in this lab)
```
* In `routes/chirps.js`, create `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` methods on a router that is created in `chirps.js`.
    * Import `chirpsstore`, and use it to read and write chirps to the json file.
        * The json file will be created the first time you run successfully!
        * Remember to export your router with `module.exports`.
* In `routes/index.js`, import the `chirps` router and add it to a new router.
    * Use `app.use` with the `/chirps` route to add to the root api router.
    * Export the router.
* In `server.js`, import the routes folder `(./routes)`.
    * Add the api router to the express app with the path `/api`.
* Test all of your methods using Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/)

## ADVANCED
* Create an `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` file in the client folder.
    * Code an app that uses jQuery to call your API and displays chirps.
        * Create a form that lets you create new chirps
            * Do not use a form submit (you only need the inputs and not necessarily a form!)
            * Use a button `click` event to call the API.
        * Add an `x` next to each chirp that will delete the chirp when clicked.
        * When a chirp is clicked, popup a modal that lets you edit the chirp.
* Remember to use `express.static` middleware!
* **HINT: jQuery functions for calling APIs: `$.ajax`, `$.get`, `$.post`
